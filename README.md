# DEISI WORLD METER (JAVA)

Manual database of all world countries, cities, and populations. This project focuses on data manipulation and query implementation with functions, classes, and tests.

- paises.csv <br>
- cidades.csv <br>
- populacao.csv <br>

These are the CSV (comma-separated value) files used in the project, located in the "test-files" folder. The files are obtained from public datasets:

https://stefangabos.github.io/world_countries/ <br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/max-mind/world-cities-database <br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/world-population-data <br>

## Guide:

1. Copy the "src" folder and paste it into the root directory of your IntelliJ workspace.

2. Copy the "test-files" folder (note that these files are large, containing thousands of lines) and paste it into the root directory of your IntelliJ workspace.

## Usage:

- In case of a compilation error, ensure that all the necessary Java utilities are included in the project.
Example:

   ![Captura de ecrã 2024-06-12 153303](https://github.com/LaercioSant0s/DEISI_World_Meter/assets/127317610/0536c333-cde5-4d94-a756-a7754e1a2a2a)

<br>

- If there are no errors, you are ready to run the project. Locate the Main class and click the run button.

The program will display a list of commands that you can choose from to interact with the information, such as adding a new "imaginary" city or removing a country.
